		<p align="justify" >I couldn’t get those enticing eyes off my mind. I wondered if she had noticed me. I lay my eyes on hers; I could live forever, on this newly found sight. It was serene. I gathered all might, breathed in deep, when she took the seat next to me. I happened to lay one irresistible glance again, and felt the moment.<br/><br/> In the next 3 hours, with a book under my desk, I wrote the best exam in a long time. I was conscious of her periodic stare; of course it was my copying she panicked. With constant deliberations to meet her or not to, days went by and nothing happened.<br/><br/> Until one day, I realized she had visited my Orkut page. It has been a blissful life ever since. She accepted my friend request a day later. We met again. A year later, I let her know – I fell in love, and I wanted to love her for a lifetime.<br/></br/>Sometimes you just look into someone’s eyes and know, those are the eyes you want to get lost in for the rest of your life. I’m glad I held on to my intuitions. Just because, she is a sky full of stars.<br/><br/>

		<p align="justify">Last minute scurrying, and I’m finally at my desk. I shut it all out and looked around the exam hall - the black board few desks away, my tense friends, and the loud recitals of by-hearted code. Suddenly, it was all mute to me. A blur of red shirt near the doorway caught my eye.<br/><br/> “Excuse me”,  he said. <br/><br/> That was one sensuous voice.He created an ambiance that pulled me out of my bearing.<br/><br/> My eyes followed the handsome demeanor, up till his seat, three rows in the front. My heart skipped a beat and my wits unconsciously wondered, “...Is he a junior? Never seen him before”. And thoughts suspended to the invigilator’s instructions to follow the seating arrangements. After all the commotions we settled at our places, where I found mine next to him :O <br/><br/>For the first time, it was endearing to sit in the exam hall. And I wrote away, 3 hours of my exam, with not a speck of thought in mind that 5 years later, I would choose to marry this man (who at that time was busy copying answers from a huge data book), in the same month as we met.<br/><br/>We have shared till this day, a beautiful friendship, our share of fights and unmeasured love. He has always stood by me, always held my hand, through all my failures, depressions, dramas and celebrations. He bestowed a belief in me, a faith I treasured and a boundless freedom to be who I am today!<br/><br/>
